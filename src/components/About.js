          <p className="mb- leading-relaxed"> I am an inspired software engineer that is accomplishment-driven, focused on sports tech. Growing up, I was passionate about sports and fascinated with the performance analytics.

          I coached college & prep football for 7 years. Priding myself on being the guy spending late nights building complex spreadsheets. During those coaching experiences I excelled in teamwork and project management.

          Looking forward, Iâ€™d love to build sports solutions through software development that improves strategy & performance. Blending measurables, stats, injuries, and coaching evaluations.
